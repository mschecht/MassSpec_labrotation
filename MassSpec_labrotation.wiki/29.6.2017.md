# Objectives:
* export list of potential lipome metabolites from SOX and MOX from genomes in Pathway tools
* continue to upload data set to XCMS
* learn about XCMS output
* start to compose biweekly report
# Notes
* Checked XCMS and bathy data set was uploaded correctly, now adding the next data set
* working with Dolma tomorrow on to practice the extraction protocol, make sure to ask her to look over antibiotic data set together.
* added Olavius data set to XCMS... need to read up on how to interpret the results from XCMS
* what other metabolites names are there for lipids... sterols etc?
    * queried the following substrings to SOX genome on Pathway tools: lipid, fatty, prenol, sterols, ketide, steroids, Terpene
* Cell Membranes by Lukas Buehler
    * lipid classes are rooted in common biosynthetic pathways
    * membrane lipids: phospholipids, glycolipids, cholesterol
* GNPS site seems to be down today
* read kleiner2012, kleine2015
* worked on biweekly report
# Outlook
* Try out GNPS again and see if site is back up
* figure out error in XCMS, if nothing get test data set from symbioses to work on query script
* finish biweekly report
