Project aim: connect metabolomic data (LC-MS/MS) with other  -omics levels
## Week 1
### Objectives
* Learn about GNPS, upload test data set
* Run anti-biotic standards on LCMS/MS
* read about LCMS/MS methods and data integration
* Start to construct pipeline to combine mass spec annotations is genomes
## Week 2
### Objectives
* Install and learn about Pathway Tools
* run samples of bathymodiolus puteoserpentis on LC-MS
    * optimize MS parameters and chromatography to well acceptable result (nice peakshape, high coverage of compounds with MS/MS trace)
    * playground: lipid standards, antibiotics etc
* Continue work on pipeline
* learn about XCMS
* Learn about Compound Discoverer
* extract list of potential lipome metabolites from genomes via Pathway Tools
## Week 3
### Objectives
* finish pipeline and run new Bathy data set
## Week 4
### Objectives
* data analysis
* genome exploration 
## Week 5
## Objectives
* prepare poster
* present at symbioses weekly meeting
